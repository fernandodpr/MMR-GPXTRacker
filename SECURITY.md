## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please open an issue in the repository. You are also encouraged to collaborate and submit a pull request with a fix.

### Guidelines
- **Scope of Review**: Only vulnerabilities directly derived from the plugin code will be reviewed. Vulnerabilities caused by dependencies will be addressed by updating the requirements. If a dependency is abandoned, transitioning to a supported project will be considered.
- **Response Time**: A best-effort approach will be used for addressing vulnerabilities.
- **Disclaimer**: As stated in other project documents, the code is provided "as is," without warranty.

### Notes
This is not a critical project, as it depends on other projects. The plugin is maintained as a collaborative effort, and contributions are welcome to improve its security and functionality.
