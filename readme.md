# GPX Tracker Plugin

The GPX Tracker plugin for Meshtastic allows you to log location data from your mesh network devices into individual GPX files. Each device's track is stored separately and organized by date, making it easy to manage and analyze location data for your devices.

## Features
- Automatically creates and updates GPX files for each device in the mesh network.
- Tracks data by date, ensuring organized and chronological records.
- Compatible with GPX visualization tools for further analysis and mapping.

## Usage
Simply add the plugin to your Meshtastic setup, and it will automatically handle incoming location data from the network.
